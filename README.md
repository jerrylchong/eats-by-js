## Setting up the environment to run the app

- Install the expo cilent run `npm install -g expo-cli` on your terminal
- Install the Expo application on your phone
- Start the application server through `expo start` on your PC
- The previous step would bring up a QR code which you can scan using your phone to open up our application!
